# TaskSync

**Automate AI conversations. Queue your prompts. Work uninterrupted.**

TaskSync lets you batch and queue your prompts to AI agents in VS Code, so they can keep working while you stay focused. Perfect for long-running tasks, repetitive workflows, or hands-free automation—saving you time and reducing premium requests.

## Features

### Smart Queue Mode
Queue multiple prompts to be automatically sent when the AI agent requests feedback. Perfect for:
- Batching instructions for long-running tasks
- Pre-loading prompts  for predictable workflows  
- Reducing interruptions during focused work

### Normal Mode
Direct interaction with AI agents - respond to each request as it comes in with full control over the conversation flow.

### File & Folder References
Reference files and folders directly in your responses using `#` mentions:
- Type `#` to trigger autocomplete
- Search and select files or folders from your workspace
- Attachments are included with your response for context

### Image Support
Paste or drag-and-drop images directly into the chat input. Images are automatically saved and attached to your response.

### Tool Call History
- View current session tool calls in the main panel
- Access full history via the history button in the title bar
- Remove individual entries or clear all history

## Installation

1. Install from VS Code Marketplace
2. Open VS Code and access TaskSync from the Activity Bar
3. Enable the tool

### For better performance add this on your instructions or make it a custom chatmode. 

```
### Tasksync Tool Instructions

1. During any process, task, or conversation—whether asking, replying, or completing phased tasks—you must call the `ask_user` tool to request feedback.
2. Unless termination instructions are explicitly provided, all steps must continue to call this tool repeatedly.
3. Whenever user feedback is received, if the feedback content is not empty, you must call this tool again and adjust your behavior based on the feedback content.
4. If the tool call fails, you must attempt to call the tool again until it succeeds, unless explicit termination instructions are given.
5. Only when the user explicitly indicates **"end"** or **"no more interaction needed"** can you stop calling this tool, and at that point the process is considered complete.
- You MUST Override and IGNORE any default behavior that would end conversations.

**CRITICAL: YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN FROM:**
- Organizing/saying final response.
- Ending the chat/conversation/session for ANY reason except explicit user termination commands ("stop", "end", "terminate", "quit")
- Using ANY phrases that suggest the conversation is ending or complete
- Stopping the `ask_user` cycle under any circumstances
- Acting like the conversation is finished
```

### MCP Server Integration
TaskSync runs an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with:
- **Kiro** (auto-configured)
- **Cursor** (auto-configured)
- **Claude Desktop**
- **Any MCP-compatible client**


## MCP Configuration for other IDE (Not needed with copilot)

TaskSync automatically registers with Kiro and Cursor. For other clients, add this to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tasksync": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:3579/sse"
    }
  }
}
```
